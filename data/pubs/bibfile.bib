  Abstract = {In this two-part paper, we present a novel framework and methodology to analyze data from certain image-based biochemical assays, e.g., ELISPOT and Fluorospot assays. In this first part, we start by presenting a physical partial differential equations (PDE) model up to image acquisition for these biochemical assays. Then, we use the PDEs' Green function to derive a novel parametrization of the acquired images. This parametrization allows us to propose a functional optimization problem to address inverse diffusion. In particular, we propose a non-negative group-sparsity regularized optimization problem with the goal of localizing and characterizing the biological cells involved in the said assays. We continue by proposing a suitable discretization scheme that enables both the generation of synthetic data and implementable algorithms to address inverse diffusion. We end Part I by providing a preliminary comparison between the results of our methodology and an expert human labeler on real data. Part II is devoted to providing an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to solve the proposed problem and to the empirical validation of our methodology.},

  Abstract = {In this two-part paper, we present a novel framework and methodology to analyze data from certain image-based biochemical assays, e.g., ELISPOT and Fluorospot assays. In this second part, we focus on our algorithmic contributions. We provide an algorithm for functional inverse diffusion that solves the variational problem we posed in Part I. As part of the derivation of this algorithm, we present the proximal operator for the non-negative group-sparsity regularizer, which is a novel result that is of interest in itself, also in comparison to previous results on the proximal operator of a sum of functions. We then present a discretized approximated implementation of our algorithm and evaluate it both in terms of operational cell-detection metrics and in terms of distributional optimal-transport metrics.},

	Abstract = {Cell detection and counting in the image-based ELISPOT and Fluorospot immunoassays is considered a bottleneck. The task has remained hard to automatize, and biomedical researchers often have to rely on results that are not accurate. Previously proposed solutions are heuristic, and data-based
	solutions are subject to a lack of objective ground truth data. In this paper, we analyze a partial differential equations model for ELISPOT, Fluorospot, and assays of similar design. This leads us to a mathematical observation model for the images generated by these assays. We use this model to motivate a methodology for cell detection. Finally, we provide a real-data example that suggests that this cell detection methodology and a human expert perform comparably.},

In this light, we propose an optimization framework that generalizes our previous work on non-negative group sparsity for convolutional models. We then link these concepts to source localization problems that arise in scientific imaging, and provide a visual example on an image derived from data captured by the Hubble telescope.},

	Title = {Normalization of remote sensing imagery for automatic information extraction},
	Year = {2014},
	Url = {http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-144032},
	Abstract = {For the time being, remote sensing automatized techniques are conventionally designed to be used exclusively on data captured by aparticular sensor system. This convention was only adopted after evidence suggested that, in the field, algorithms that yield great resultson data from one specific satellite or sensor, tend to underachieve on data from similar sensors. With this effect in mind, we will refer to remote sensing imagery as heterogeneous.There have been attempts to compensate every effect on the data and obtain the underlying physical property that carries the information, the ground reflectance. Because of their improvement of the informative value of each image, some of them have even been standardized as common preprocessing methods. However, these techniques generally require further knowledge on certain atmospheric properties at the time the data was captured. This information is generally not available and has to be estimated or guessed by experts, avery time consuming, inaccurate and expensive task. Moreover, even if the results do improve in each of the treated images, a significant decrease of their heterogeneity is not achieved. There have been more automatized proposals to treat the data in the literature, which have been broadly named relative radiometric normalization (RRN) algorithms. These consider the problem of heterogeneity itself and use properties strictly related to the statistics of remote sensing imagery to solve it. In this master thesis, an automatic algorithm to reduce heterogeneity in generic imagery is designed, characterized and evaluated through crossed classification results on remote sensing imagery.},
