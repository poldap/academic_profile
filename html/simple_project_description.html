The work we did is about how to make a computer find and count spots in a kind of pictures. The pictures we care about come from people that study how living things work. These people want to know about the number of spots and where to find them. They care because if they know, then they can find out what the small pieces that make up living things are doing in a very controlled situation. In this way, they can learn more and help more people live well.
