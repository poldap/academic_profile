<h3>Research Biography</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"> 
    In August 2014, I obtained a double 5-year degree, <i>Enginyer de Telecomunicació</i> (Telecommunications Engineering, UPC BarcelonaTech, Barcelona, Catalonia) and <i>Civilingejör inom Elektroteknik</i> (Electrical Engineering, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden). Since then, I work at the Department of Information Science and Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology as a PhD student under the supervision of Professor Joakim Jaldén.

    In August 2015, I became a reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, and I have since given reviews to two papers. Through 2017, I was awarded four different travel grants to support the international promotion of my research in inverse problems in imaging, amounting to the approximate total amount of 43000 SEK. These grants were awarded to me by the <i>KTH Opportunities Fund</i>, the <i>Knut and Alice Wallenberg Jubilee appropriation</i>, the <i>Åforsk Foundation</i> and <i>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</i> (KVA, call ES2017-0011).

    During the academic year 2017 - 2018, I have presented my work on the use of proximal optimization methods for inverse diffusion, source localization and convolutional sparse coding at different venues. In November 2017, I gave an oral presentation at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, UK (see <a href="#/talks">Talks</a>), within the workshop <i>Generative models, parameter learning and sparsity</i> (VMVW02). In April 2018, I had poster presentations in ISBI 2018, Washington D.C., USA, and ICASSP 2018, Calgary, AB, CA, and was in a week-long research stay at Stephen Boyd's research group at the Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University. In June 2018, I had a poster presentation in SIAM IS 2018, Bologna, Italy. Finally, in July 2018 I attended ICML 2018 and the workshops <i>Modern Trends in Nonconvex Optimization for Machine Learning</i> and <i>Machine Learning for Causal Inference, Counterfactual Prediction, and Autonomous Action</i> therein, in Stockholm, Sweden. Through this same year, my contributions have been published in two conference papers and two journal papers (see <a href="#/pubs">Publications</a>).
