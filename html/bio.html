<h3>Research Biography</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"> 
    In September 2019, I obtained a <i>Teknologie doktorsexamen inom elektro- och systemteknik</i> (Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, 
    <b>KTH Royal Institute of Technology</b>, Stockholm, Sweden). Before that, I obtained a double 5-year engineering degree, 
    <i>Enginyer de Telecomunicació</i> (Telecommunications Engineering, <b>UPC BarcelonaTech</b>, Barcelona, Catalonia) and 
    <i>Civilingejör inom Elektroteknik</i> (Electrical Engineering, <b>KTH Royal Institute of Technology</b>, Stockholm, Sweden). 
    Since October 2019, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Group at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, within the 
    Signal Processing core of the Center for Biomedical Imaging.

    In August 2015 and Bla 2018, I became a <b>reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</b> and <b>Elsevier Signal Processing</b>,
    respectively. 
    During my Ph.D., I was awarded a number of travel <b>grants</b> amounting to a total of <b>64200 SEK</b> (among others, the Åforsk
    Foundation travel grant and the KVA Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Engineering Sciences grant) to support the international promotion
    of my research in inverse problems in imaging, as two research visits (Stephen Boyd's research group</b> at the Information Systems 
    Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, <b>Stanford</b> University, <b>CosmoStat</b>, <b>Jean-Luc Starck's group in CEA 
    Paris-Saclay</b>).

    I have presented my work on the use of proximal optimization methods for inverse diffusion, source localization and convolutional sparse coding at different venues. In November 2017, I gave an oral presentation at the <b>Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences</b> at the University of <b>Cambridge, UK</b> (see <a href="#/talks">Talks</a>), within the workshop <i>Generative models, parameter learning and sparsity</i> (VMVW02). In April 2018, I had poster presentations in <b>ISBI 2018</b>, Washington D.C., USA, and <b>ICASSP 2018</b>, Calgary, AB, CA, and was in a week-long <b>research stay at Stephen Boyd's research group</b> at the Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, <b>Stanford</b> University. In June 2018, I had a poster presentation in <b>SIAM IS 2018</b>, Bologna, Italy. In July 2018 I <b>attended ICML 2018</b> and the <b>workshops</b> <i>Modern Trends in <b>Nonconvex Optimization</b> for Machine Learning</i> and <i>Machine Learning for <b>Causal Inference</b>, Counterfactual Prediction, and Autonomous Action</i> therein, in Stockholm, Sweden. In January 2019, I was visiting <b>CosmoStat</b>, <b>Jean-Luc Starck's group in CEA Paris-Saclay</b>. In that context, I presented my work on optimization for inverse diffusion both <a href="http://www.cosmostat.org/events/cosmoclub/cosmosclub-pol">at CosmoStat</a> and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/parietal/slides-of-pol-del-aguila-plas-talk-available-now-online/">at Parietal</a> (Inria-CEA, Neurospin). In April 2019, I presented my work on deep learning methods inspired on optimization for inverse diffusion and source localization in an oral presentation at <b>ISBI 2019</b>, Venice, Italy. Furthemore, I also had 
    the pleasure to attend the IEEE SPS long-range planning meeting at the same 
    venue.

    During my M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies, I have published in the proceedings of IGARSS 2014, ISBI 2018, ICASSP 2018 and ISBI 2019, and in the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (for more details, see <a href="#/pubs">Publications</a>).
