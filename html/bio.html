<h3>Academic Biography</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"> 
    In August 2014, I obtained a double 5-year degree, Telecommunication Engineer (TelecomBCN, Barcelona, Catalonia) and Civilingejör in Electrical Engineering (KTH, Stockholm, Sweden). Since then, I work at the Department of Information Science and Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology as a PhD student under the supervision of Professor Joakim Jaldén.

    In August 2015, I became a reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, and I have since given reviews to two papers. Through 2017, I was awarded four different travel grants to support the international promotion of my research in inverse problems in imaging, amounting to the approximate total amount of 43000 SEK. These grants were awarded to me by the <i>KTH Opportunities Fund</i>, the <i>Knut and Alice Wallenberg Jubilee appropriation</i>, the <i>Åforsk Foundation</i> and <i>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</i> (KVA, call ES2017-0011).

    In November 2017, I presented my work on inverse diffusion for cell detection using proximal optimization methods at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, UK (see <a href="/~poldap/#/talks">Talks</a>), within the workshop <i>Generative models, parameter learning and sparsity</i> (VMVW02). In April 2017, I will attend ISBI 2018, Washington D.C., USA, and ICASSP 2018, Calgary, AB, CA, where I will present the results in the two respective recently accepted papers (see <a href="/~poldap/#/pubs">Publications</a>). In June 2017, I will attend SIAM IS 2018 to present further work on inverse problems for source localization in imaging.
