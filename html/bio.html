<h3>Research Biography</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify"> 
    In August 2014, I obtained a double 5-year degree, <i>Enginyer de Telecomunicació</i> (Telecommunications Engineering, <b>UPC BarcelonaTech</b>, Barcelona, Catalonia) and <i>Civilingejör inom Elektroteknik</i> (Electrical Engineering, <b>KTH Royal Institute of Technology</b>, Stockholm, Sweden). Since then, I work on my Ph.D. at the Division of Information Science and Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, <b>KTH Royal Institute of Technology</b> under the supervision of Professor Joakim Jaldén.

    In August 2015, I became a <b>reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</b>. Through my Ph.D., I have been awarded different <b>travel grants</b> to support the international promotion of my research in inverse problems in imaging, as well as diverse research visits, amounting to the approximate total of <b>64200 SEK</b>. These grants were awarded to me by the <i>KTH Opportunities Fund</i>, the <i>Knut and Alice Wallenberg Jubilee appropriation</i>, the <i>Åforsk Foundation</i>, <i>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</i> (KVA, call ES2017-0011), and the <i>School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</i> at KTH.

    I have presented my work on the use of proximal optimization methods for inverse diffusion, source localization and convolutional sparse coding at different venues. In November 2017, I gave an oral presentation at the <b>Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences</b> at the University of <b>Cambridge, UK</b> (see <a href="#/talks">Talks</a>), within the workshop <i>Generative models, parameter learning and sparsity</i> (VMVW02). In April 2018, I had poster presentations in <b>ISBI 2018</b>, Washington D.C., USA, and <b>ICASSP 2018</b>, Calgary, AB, CA, and was in a week-long <b>research stay at Stephen Boyd's research group</b> at the Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, <b>Stanford</b> University. In June 2018, I had a poster presentation in <b>SIAM IS 2018</b>, Bologna, Italy. In July 2018 I <b>attended ICML 2018</b> and the <b>workshops</b> <i>Modern Trends in <b>Nonconvex Optimization</b> for Machine Learning</i> and <i>Machine Learning for <b>Causal Inference</b>, Counterfactual Prediction, and Autonomous Action</i> therein, in Stockholm, Sweden. In January 2019, I was visiting <b>CosmoStat</b>, <b>Jean-Luc Starck's group in CEA Paris-Saclay</b>. In that context, I presented my work on optimization for inverse diffusion both <a href="http://www.cosmostat.org/events/cosmoclub/cosmosclub-pol">at CosmoStat</a> and <a href="https://team.inria.fr/parietal/slides-of-pol-del-aguila-plas-talk-available-now-online/">at Parietal</a> (Inria-CEA, Neurospin). In April 2019, I will present my work on deep learning methods inspired on optimization for inverse diffusion and source localization in <b>ISBI 2019</b>, Venice, Italy.

    During my M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies, I have published in the proceedings of IGARSS 2014, ISBI 2018, ICASSP 2018 and ISBI 2019, and in the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (for more details, see <a href="#/pubs">Publications</a>).
