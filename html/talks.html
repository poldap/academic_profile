            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate cell detection and counting in the image-based ELISpot and FluoroSpot immunoassays is a challenging task. Methodology recently proposed by our group matches human accuracy by leveraging knowledge of the underlying physical process of these assays and using state-of-the-art iterative techniques to solve an inverse problem. Nonetheless, thousands of computationally expensive iterations are often needed to reach a near-optimal solution. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the iterations to design a parameterized computation graph, <i>SpotNet</i>, that learns the characteristic patterns embedded within several training images and their respective cell secretion information. Further, we compare SpotNet to a customized convolutional neural network layout for cell detection based on recent advances. We show empirical evidence that, while both designs obtain a detection performance far beyond that of a human expert, SpotNet is substantially easier to train and obtains better estimates of cell secretion. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this poster, I will present an inverse problem framework to detect point and extended sources in scientific imaging. With clear applications in biology, medical sciences and astronomy, among others, our proposal is a blind deconvolution approach that allows for spatially variant point spread functions. The methodology builds on the extensive research in convolutional coding in deep learning and signal processing, and introduces group-sparsity constraints to this context. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we present a new interpretation of non-negatively constrained convolutional coding problems as blind deconvolution problems with spatially variant point spread function. In this light, we propose an optimization framework that generalizes our previous work on non-negative group sparsity for convolutional models. We then link these concepts to source localization problems that arise in scientific imaging, and provide a visual example on an image derived from data captured by the Hubble telescope.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell detection and counting in the image-based ELISPOT and Fluorospot immunoassays is considered a bottleneck. The task has remained hard to automatize, and biomedical researchers often have to rely on results that are not accurate. Previously proposed solutions are heuristic, and data-based solutions are subject to a lack of objective ground truth data. In this paper, we analyze a partial differential equations model for ELISPOT, Fluorospot, and assays of similar design. This leads us to a mathematical observation model for the images generated by these assays. We use this model to motivate a methodology for cell detection. Finally, we provide a real-data example that suggests that this cell detection methodology and a human expert perform comparably.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Biological assays in which particles generated by cells bind to a surface and can be imaged to reveal the cells' location are ubiquitous in biochemical, pharmacological and medical research. In this talk, I will describe the physics of these processes, a 3D radiation-diffusion-adsorption-desorption partial differential equation, and present our novel parametrization of its solution (i.e., the observation model) in terms of convolutional operators. Then, I will present our proposal to invert this observation model through a functional optimization problem with group-sparsity regularization and explain the reasoning behind this choice of regularizer. I will also present the results needed to derive the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm for this problem, and justify why we chose to formulate the algorithm in the original function spaces where our observation model operates. Finally, I will briefly comment on our choice of discretization, and show the final performance of our algorithm in both synthetic and real data.</p>
